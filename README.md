# Getting starting with React

This base project was made with the purpose of having more control
over our projects, having full control over each of the webpack,
jest, testing-library, and babel plugins.
Unlike using create-react-app where there is already a
base configuration without many options to choose from.

Technologies used:

- React 18.x
- Typescript 4.8.x
- Webpack 5.x
- Babel 7.x
- Jest 29.x
- Testing-library 13.x
- Eslint 8.x
- Emotion
- Styled Components

In addition to the technologies mentioned above, which are
included in a react base project, the following were used to make
the work more efficient:

- Prettier 2.x
- Husky 8.x
- Lint-staged 13.x

## Available scripts

#### start the project on `http://localhost:3000`
